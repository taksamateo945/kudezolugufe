Klum, on the other hand, has been dating bodyguard <strong>Martin Kirsten</strong> since last summer.</p><p>"I cherish all of the great memories Seal and I created together over the years," the Project Runway host told <strong>Us</strong> in September. "Our separation was based on issues between the two of us. Seal has moved on and so have I."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqemZxiwLWxz6xkqK2kYsSqwMdmp6ivlad6s63NoJyrq12WsLW%2BxKyqZp2inrtur8ChoKWkXaS7pnnYnpirZZGbwaa%2BjKGcopyZYritwcxmqqmkmal6c3yQbGhs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
