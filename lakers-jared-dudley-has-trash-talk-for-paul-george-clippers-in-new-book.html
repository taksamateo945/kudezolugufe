(On Wednesday, it was <a href=#>No.&nbsp;1 on Amazon in the one-hour biography</a> and memoir short reads).</p><p>On those e-pages, Dudley included a section about the Lakers’ crosstown rivals: “We hear some of those guys talking about how they’re the team to beat in L.A.,” he wrote. “It’s fine if Kawhi (Leonard) says stuff like that. He’s defending a championship. We don’t trip if someone like Patrick Beverley is talking trash; that’s how he feeds his family. We get it. We respect the hustle.</p><p>“But we think it’s disrespectful for Paul George, who hasn’t won, to put himself on the level of ’Bron and A.D. This motivates us.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jared Dudley’s new book is a must-read/listen for a ton more stories like this one. <a href=#>https://t.co/CdHDFP5LWE</a></p><p>— Harrison Faigen (@hmfaigen) <a href=#>February 3, 2021</a></p><p>After practice Wednesday, Dudley told reporters what he wrote carried on a long tradition of smack talk.</p><p>“It comes to this,” Dudley said, “Number one: Trash talking and talking is important in basketball. Anyone, Paul George, Kawhi, sometimes you might say … it’s a lot of talk from that person. But what it all comes down to is players look for motivation. …</p><p>“I know the difference of how we perceive them, they perceive us, the rivalry, the inside, the Lakers getting all the media attention, the Clippers don’t,” added Dudley, who played for the Clippers in 2013-14. “And at this time (last season), this is when Kawhi could have came to the Lakers. And he chose the Clippers, and his thing, and does the commercial with the crown. And right there, with him not saying anything, that’s already a shot right there. ‘New Kings of L.A.,’ which is fine, which I actually like in basketball when it comes to certain stuff, uh, adding to the rivalry. Pat Bev (Patrick Beverley) does it.”</p><p>Asked about the passage in Dudley’s book before his Clippers tipped off in Cleveland, Coach Tyronn Lue tried to refrain, in this case, from adding any such stuff to the bulletin board.</p><p>Partly because he was stunned, at first, to hear that Dudley was a published author.</p><p>“A book? Jared Dudley?” Lue asked.</p><p>After getting some context, Lue’s response was a restrained rated G.</p><p>“I know I probably can’t cuss on here so I won’t cuss,” Lue said. “But who cares?”</p><p>He said his message to George – an Olympic gold medalist, six-time All-Star, five-time All-NBA selection and the 2013 Most Improved Player who, yes, struggled with his shot during the Clippers’ short-lived postseason in the bubble – is simple.</p><p>“Just be who you are, play your game,” Lue said. “Who cares what people say, and what the outside people think? You know we know how we feel about PG – our team, our organization. And that’s all that matters.</p><p>“He’s having a great season, a great year. He’s healthy. He’s done a lot of great things for this team. And that’s all we’re worried about. As far as for me, I really don’t care what people say on the outside. And, you know, I hope PG doesn’t either.”</p><p>Entering Wednesday’s game, George is averaging 23.7 points, 6.3 rebounds and 5.4 assists while shooting 49.8% from the field, 45.3% from 3-point range and 91.4% from the free-throw line for the Clippers (16-6).</p><p>For his part, Dudley also credited the Clippers for their strong play to start the season, early season performances that also serve as motivation in a way, noted Dudley – who is aware, it seems, that he might provide fuel for the guys in the locker room down the hall.</p><p>“I think you can tell they have a sense of focus, a sense of determination,” said the 14th-year reserve, who has appeared in six games this season for the Lakers (16-6). “Paul George and Kawhi are playing at high, high levels. And I just think they have a chance … if you were going to ask me who we’re gonna play, I thought we were going to play the Clippers in the Western Conference finals. I expected them to be there. I expect them to be there this year.</p><p>“They have the talent, they have the All-Stars, they have great coaching and stuff like that, and I think this is all part of basketball. I think the league needs it. The league needs us to play the Clippers, the league needs us to play Brooklyn. I’m all for (the media) doing your job and having stars playing each other, so we view them highly.</p><p>“And we all look for motivation, and for us, when it comes to certain people and what they say – there’s a reason why LeBron and A.D. don’t say anything when it comes to other teams and what they’re gonna do, they just go out there and do it. That’s their personality. I like to talk, PatBev likes to talk, people add their own different personalities in. You take certain things and put them in the back and remember what people said.”</p><p>Staff writer Kyle Goon contributed to this story.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnJa4pr7SZqGaqpWZeqXBw6WcsmWYlsBuwNGaqqFlpJa5rHnFqKlmqJGquW6zxKipoJ1dmLmqvM%2BeqaxlmaN6r7HWZpmop5tk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
