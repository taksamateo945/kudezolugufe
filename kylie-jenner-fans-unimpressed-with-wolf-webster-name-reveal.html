The makeup mogul, 26, updated her Instagram as she modeled items from the “quiet luxury” line she’s been low-key hinting at recently, and fans seem to be loving it. Kylie has been dubbed the world’s “youngest self-made billionaire” thanks to her Kylie Cosmetics brand. Alongside running her makeup line, the reality star is also the founder of Kylie Skin, Kylie Baby, and Kylie Swim. In her recent shares, Kylie revealed what fans can shop. She also dropped the cool, KarJenner-style name she’s chosen for her collections.</p><h2>Launches Clothing Line</h2><p>Modeling multiple looks, Kylie revealed her line to be trendy and edgy. In one image, the sister to Kendall Jenner posed on the floor and wearing a black, faux-leather trench coat that showed off her toned legs as she added in a bold red pair of stiletto heels.</p><p>Seemingly wearing nothing beneath her coat, Kylie shot the camera a sultry gaze as she rocked her dark locks down, also flaunting the plump pout behind her 2015-founded cosmetics brand.</p><h2>Reveals Brand Name</h2><p>Also shared was a shot of Kylie in a leggy shorts look as she posed near a radiator and in a tight boxer-style pair of white briefs paired with a slightly cropped matching tee. Going for button detailing around the chest, Kylie added pizzazz to her outfit via a shaggy green coat worn open. The California native completed her outfit via white ankle socks and simple black loafers.</p><p>In her IG posts, Kylie tagged Khy, her new brand. She also shouted out&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal, which has crowned her Innovator of the Year.</p><h2>It’s Called Khy</h2><p>Kylie hasn’t too much about her brand, but she has dished a little on what the new venture represents for her.</p><p>“Khy is a homage to the limitless possibilities of fashion,” she said in a statement. “We are breaking down barriers and will redefine the meaning of a fashion brand, with creativity and quality at a better price.” She added: “I wanted to make Khy a platform for our customers to have the opportunity to experience fashion through new designers and brands.” Also known for retailing popular clothing lines are sisters Kim and Khloe Kardashian. Meanwhile, siblings Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner run Poosh, Lemme, and 818 tequila, respectively.</p><h2>Says She Has A ‘Strong Vision’</h2><p>In her&nbsp;WSJ interview, Kylie further revealed:</p><p>“Creatively I have such a strong vision of what I want to look like and what I want to do and what I want to wear,” adding: “There’s really no one telling me what to do.”</p><p>Everything from Ky retails for under $200. Kylie has also set up Khy with an IG account, which has gained 100,000 followers in a day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnm665qrGMo5ynppWneqetzaxkrqaZor2zsdKsnJ1lp57BqXnWqKOfZaear7TAxKtkp5mdmnqzsdWemKVn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
