After much frustration with the online system being down for the past several days resulting in tremendous queues (some people even queuing for 3 consecutive days), this man and his team jumped in and showed tremendous commitment to the public. "When the system came online sometime during the afternoon, they decided to keep the doors open after their normal closing time (15:30). They still served us with a smile at 19:00 last night. When we thanked Mr Loate his reply was "I'm here to work mam. We want to serve the people". "People like Mr Loate and his team make it a pleasure to be staying in our beautiful country. #ImStaying right here," she wrote.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/b76eede28d585a9b.png><p class=align-left>Impressed Stayers had this to say:</p><p class=align-left>Lucinda Rossam said:</p>"Wish a few other Home Affairs would read this.

Batho Pele at its best.<p class=align-left>In other <strong>We </strong>news, a grateful South African woman, Zeenat Patel, recently shared how a <a href=#>good-hearted OR Tambo employee named Nobuhle</a> displayed real decency after returning her mother's cellphone that was lost at the airport.</p>"I have to share this wonderful story of Nobuhle who works at O.R. Thambo Aiport. I picked up my parents from the airport earlier at Terminal B. When we arrived home we realised that my mom was missing her cellphone. "We rushed straight back to the airport from Pretoria. She refused to accept a reward as this is company policy. It is extremely rare to not only find lost cellphones but to find them in an airport with hundreds and thousands of people," she wrote.<p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?
