She broke down the items she wore along with her hair and makeup and gave credit to where they were due.</p><p>For her hair and makeup, Katy Perry credited exhaustion. Her nursing bra is from Medela US (yes, Katy Perry is breastfeeding her baby Daisy) and her post-partum undies are from Frida Mom.</p><p>Katy Perry shared the photo on her official Instagram story, where she has 105 million followers.
