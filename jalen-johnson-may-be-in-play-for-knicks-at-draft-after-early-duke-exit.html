The Knicks select 19th, 21st, 32nd and 58th but are interviewing players in the lottery with an eye on packaging picks to move up.</p><p>The Knicks interviewed the 6-foot-9 Johnson on Wednesday at the draft combine in Chicago. In 13 games for Duke, he averaged 11.2 points and shot 44 percent from 3-point range. With the Knicks all but giving up on Kevin Knox, they could use a young small forward to add to the mix.</p><p>“It was a tough decision to make,’’ Johnson said. “At the end of the day, I had support from coaches and teammates. I was doing what’s best for my family and myself, making sure I was 100 percent prepared for the draft and being the best version of myself.’’</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Jalen Johnson <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, who is close to Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski, raised eyebrows when he <a href=#>took a swipe on his radio show at Johnson</a> for leaving the team.</p><p>“That guy was hurting them, so they actually are much better now without him,’’ Boeheim said. “He was just doing some things and keeping other people from playing that are good. They’ve had two monster wins since he’s opted out.”</p><p>Sounds like the move wasn’t all flowers and candy. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau worked closely with Coach K and Boeheim on Team USA.</p><p>“I don’t care what others have to say about it,’’ Johnson said Thursday. “At the end of the day, they’re not in my shoes. I did what was best for me — not what other people wanted me to do. I wasn’t paying attention to what anyone was saying media-wise. I’m happy with the decision.’’</p><p>His draft stock may have fallen but workouts could change the flow. Johnson compared himself to Ben Simmons for being “able to pass well for my size.”</p><p>That’s not the most glowing comp at the moment, especially since Johnson showed 3-point potential in limited duty. However, Johnson shot a Simmons-like 52.3 percent from the free-throw line.</p><p>“I’m a very versatile player, can guard multiple positions,’’ Johnson said. “There’s a lot of things I bring to the table — the passing and making everyone around me better.’’</p><p>It’s a 3-point-shooting league, and Johnson, in limited attempts, at least shot well in 13 college games. He was 8-of-18.</p><p>“I’m going to prove a lot of people wrong and show people that aspect of my game,’’ Johnson said. “I’m developing a consistent outside shot and excited to show it at the next level. I want to perfect it, make it a weapon.’’</p><p>Baylor point guard Jared Butler said he interviewed with the Knicks on Thursday. He could be there at No. 19. …. Though the Knicks interviewed Florida State’s star forward Scott Barnes, he thinks he can still break into the top five when it’s all said and done. All mock drafts have Barnes behind the Cade Cunningham-Jalen Green-Jalen Suggs-Evan Mobley-Jonathan Kuminga quintet.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmpa5prqMo6ahpqOku265wLJkm51dnrtuvMuasGaen6d6rLrInKKsZZGpeqW%2BwJ%2BrZpmWqbKzecSaqaWxXZnCrLGMnq%2BirF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
