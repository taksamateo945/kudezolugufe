We’re enjoying nature here.”&nbsp; Tracey and her sons also went dog sledding on the Mendenhall Glacier.</p><p>While some believe that having it all is not possible, Edmonds believes that it is possible to be happy and a great success. “To me, having it all means having inner peace and happiness, and I believe that a woman can attain that. She can have a fulfilling career, and she can have children, and she can have a happy personal life, but there are going to be some imperfections there, and hurdles from time to time and you just have to expect that and embrace all that comes with it,” <a href=#>says</a> the actress.</p><p>Tracey is currently working on a new sitcom that is centrally based on her life as a mom. As she explains,&nbsp; “I’m developing a scripted TV show for Fox right now that’s loosely based on my life. [It’s] about a single mom trying to raise two boys [while facing] the struggles of juggling a career, raising kids, and trying to date.”</p><p>Brandon and Dylan are Tracey and Babyface’s only two children together.</p><p><strong>Check out more pictures of the family below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kGtmamhfZYFwwNGamp6xXZqxrrvNnapmmZ6ZerS7zaxkoKddrLWiuMRmrpqsk522r7OO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
