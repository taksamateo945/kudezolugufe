On Wednesday, August 14, BTS’ song “<a href=#>Intro: Singularity,</a>” from the group’s<a href=#> Love Yourself: Tear</a> album, has officially sold over 100,000 units in the United States. What makes the feat so impressive is that “Intro: Singularity” was not promoted as a single.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@BTS_twt</a>'s "Intro: Singularity" has now sold over 100,000 units in the US.</p><p>— chart data (@chartdata) <a href=#>August 14, 2019</a></p><p>Before BTS released Love Yourself: Tear on May 18, 2018, the group dropped a visual for “Intro: Singularity” that worked as the <a href=#>group’s comeback trailer</a>. Both the track and visual for “Intro: Singularity” star V, whose real name is <a href=#>Kim Taehyung</a>.</p><p></p><p>The song’s achievement comes just days after V released a solo single called “<a href=#>Winter Bear”</a> on August 9. V produced “Winter Bear” with BTS’ RM, as well as Hiss noise and ADORA. Earlier this year on January 30, V also released his <a href=#>self-composed song “Scenery.</a>” Unlike “Intro: Singularity,” which is under BTS’ name, “Winter Bear” and “Scenery” were released solely by V for free on Soundcloud, which is a testament to how dedicated and passionate the BTS member is about releasing his own individual music.</p><p>You can watch the music video for “Winter Bear” below, which was also directed by V.</p><p></p><p>As of right now, V, along with RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, and Jungkook, are all taking an “<a href=#>extended period of rest and relaxation</a>,” as stated in a statement released by BTS’ management company, Big Hit Entertainment. <a href=#>BTS is expected to return from their hiatus sometime in October</a>, as the group has concerts scheduled in Saudi Arabia and Korea.</p><h3>What is your favorite song by BTS’ V?
