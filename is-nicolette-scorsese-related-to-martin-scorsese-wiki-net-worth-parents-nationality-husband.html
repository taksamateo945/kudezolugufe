However, Nicolette had a good run while her career lasted.</p><h2><span id=IsNicolette_Scorsese_related_to_Martin_Scorsese>Is&nbsp;Nicolette Scorsese related to Martin Scorsese?</span></h2><p>When many people hear the name Nicolette Scorsese, what&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>comes to their mind</a>&nbsp;is the famous film director Martin Scorsese; after all, they share the same surname. What they want to know is whether the two people are related. The truth is that they do not share any kind of relationship, although sharing a surname and working together. Martin Scorsese is older than Nicolette by 12 years, but he has never been married to her. Working in Hollywood is their only relationship and nothing else; while Martin has been married five times, Nicolette has never married.</p><h2><span id=Nicolette_Scorsese_Personal_Life_Dating_or_Husband>Nicolette Scorsese Personal Life, Dating or Husband</span></h2><p>Despite the success she gained in her career, Nicolette has not been so lucky with her love life. At her age, she&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>has never been married</a>, however, this does not necessarily mean that Nicolette has never dated. In 1988, Nicolette is said to have dated Jellybean Benitez. However, the couple went their separate ways after a number of months. She has also dated a number of Hollywood celebrities, for example Sean Penn back in the 1990s, appearing together publicly at the First Annual International Rock Awards, held at the NY State Armory, but union did not last long, and they went their separate ways after a year. That same year, Nicolette dated model Antonio Sabato Jr., an affair they started after she met him while pursuing her modeling career. The relationship did not go beyond that, and they also parted ways.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Nicolette was also seen on various occasions with Billy Duffy, a musician ,in the late 1990s, and the couple was rumored to be sharing a daughter, Shiloh Duffy, but the couple never confirmed the rumor, and after years of dating, they broke-up.</p><p>Apparently Nicolette is not dating anyone currently, and is also not linked to any person. Since she has always shared her love life openly in the past, it is only right to assume that she is currently single and unmarried.</p><h2><span id=Nicolette_Scorsese_Net_Worth>Nicolette Scorsese Net Worth</span></h2><p>Although Nicolette’s acting career came to an end more than a decade ago, she had made a fortune for herself.
