Another claimed Tyra had an “expressionless face” and they didn’t like what she had to offer.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CFIps_9BGNe/</p><p>Fans of the series know that the 65-year-old Bergeron, and Andrews, 42, recently lost their jobs. They announced they were leaving in July of this year. Bergeron had acted as the host since it first started in 2005 whereas Andrews joined as a co-host in 2014.</p><p>Regarding her job loss, Andrews claimed she was feeling sorry for herself because it was such a terrible time to lose her job. She added that getting primetime television show employment was a challenging job to get, even without a pandemic.</p><p>During a chat with The Post, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Banks</a>, who has been an executive producer for years, claimed she never wanted to be a “host-for-hire.” The creator of America’s Next Top Model claimed she and her mother sat down one evening and talked about all of the great things she can bring to the series.</p><p>Banks says part of what makes live TV so great is the mistakes and the “mess-ups,” as well as pointing them out when they actually occur. According to Page Six, the 29th season of Dancing With The Stars is currently subjected to COVID-19 protocols and safety measures, like many other programs.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Amid the pandemic this year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBCUniversal</a> announced they were going to shut down approximately 35 of their productions.
