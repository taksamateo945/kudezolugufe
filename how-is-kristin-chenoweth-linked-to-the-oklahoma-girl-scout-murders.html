She was meant to be at Camp Scott, the sleepaway camp where the killings took place, but she was unable to go due to sickness.&nbsp;In the ABC program, Chenoweth and detectives look further into the unresolved case 45 years later. The four-part docuseries, which launches on Hulu on May 24, investigates the killings in June 1977 of Lori Lee Farmer, Michele Heather Guse, and Doris Denise Milner.</p><h2>Is Kristin Chenoweth Anyhow Connected to the Oklahoma Girl Scout murders?</h2><p>The terrible childhood memory was disclosed by Chenoweth in the trailer for the ABC News Studio documentary Keeper of the Ashes: The Oklahoma Girl Scout Murders, which was published on Monday, May 16.</p><p>Chenoweth said,</p><p>“I remember I was supposed to go on that vacation, but I became ill, and mum said, ‘You can’t go.'” It has been with me my whole life. I could have passed for one of them. When I think about those three girls, I wonder how I can best honor them. That’s why I’d returned home, to finally get answers. “</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kristin-Chenoweth-2.jpg alt="Kristin Chenoweth" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Chenoweth maintains that her near-death experience has altered her life forever.</p><p>“There’s no resolution,” she remarked. “There isn’t a lovely red bow at the end.”<br>She stated:</p><p>“It bothers me every day, yet this is a narrative that must be shared.”</p><h2>Detailed Of the Murders and killings and investigation</h2><p>In 1977, a troop of Girl Scouts arrived at Camp Scott in Locust Grove, Oklahoma. On the first night of the trip, three Girl Scouts, Lori Farmer, 8, Michele Guse, 9, and Doris Denise Milner, 10, were sexually raped and killed outside their tent.&nbsp;Ten days later, Gene Leroy Hart, 35, was apprehended as a suspect. While doing time for unrelated offenses, Hart fled from jail.&nbsp;Hart was accused with three charges of first-degree murder, but he was acquitted by a jury in 1979. He died in jail later that year, while serving his initial term.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kristin-Chenoweth-4.jpg alt="Kristin Chenoweth" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After the remains of the girls were found, Camp Scott was evacuated and closed down. However, Sheriff Mike Reed disclosed the findings of some 2019 DNA testing last Monday. At the request of the victims’ families, the findings were made public.&nbsp;Reed states that the new tests produced partial profiles of the killer, which could be used to rule out other suspects:</p><p>“Unless anything new comes out, something brought to light that we are not aware of, I am sure of Hart’s culpability and participation in this case from where I am.”</p><p></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dnsBut9Giqq2hnmKwqbHNqK6erJhiuaq6yp6bZqyfYsGpsYyooqWZmKS6onnGoqmlZaOYvLbAjKasq5yVp8Bw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
