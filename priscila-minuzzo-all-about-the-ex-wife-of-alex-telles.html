The wedding was magnificent and looked like something out of a fairy tale, beginning with a church ceremony at the Sao Pelegrino and ending with a huge celebration. Among the visitors was musician Joao Pedro Gregol, who performed and sang for the audience.&nbsp;Priscila was serenaded by her husband Alex, who added to the excitement of the gathering.
