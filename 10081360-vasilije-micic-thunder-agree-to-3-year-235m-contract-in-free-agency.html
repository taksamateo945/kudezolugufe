Presti is still building for the future, with a healthy Chet Holmgren entering the fray for 2023-24, but he's planning on putting a competitive roster on the floor.</p><p>Micić provides nice backcourt depth behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey. Maybe he'll be a meaningful contributor on the next Thunder team that reaches the playoffs.</p><p>Having him under contract for three years leaves open an opportunity to cash in on a trade as well if he ultimately has more value within that context.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGaAd3yMr5isoZyet6Z5zKKaoptdqbW2usOeqWaZl6eypnnTqGRsZamarrN5kWxspmWTpLu1vsCcq2ahnmKzs7HEZpignZ6Yxg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
