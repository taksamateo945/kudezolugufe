It has been a year since you transitioned, the pain’s heavy today just as it was a year ago, God knows that I would give anything to see you again.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-a8pxjBPnS/</p><p>‘I didn’t think that I was going to survive one second of any of this, prayers kept me together, the kids also keep me going and God’s grace has carried me this far. As today makes one year, I stand strong because of you, As I know you would not have it any other way, as I recall every late-night conversation that we had about resilience and about fear, because you were my greatest teacher and you are still with us, in spirit,’ she went on to write.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Lauren’s caption ended with an even more emotional conclusion: ‘With every breath I take, I honor you. I carry this pain with purpose, I promise I will make you proud, I promise to apply everything you taught me in life and in death Ermias Asghedom. There will never be another until we are together again….I love you beyond human understanding (but you know that already).’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeclsKzsc1mo6imlKS7brzOrKusZZWivLW1zqeYpWWkp7ajwdOeZJplqZqus3nAn6ueql2jtrG%2FxLJkoa2jqLmmv4ypmKyrmaO0bn%2BXbGxvbl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
