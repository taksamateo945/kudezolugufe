He is one of the world’s few billionaires and the richest man in Africa. His sources of wealth sparse from many sectors in the Dangote Group, including cement factories, consumable production outlets, indigenous and foreign investments.</strong></p><p>Aliko Dangote is a descendant of an early Nigerian financial-social elite family of Dantata. He is an entrepreneur who has maintained the family’s status on that capital scale and carries on young promising potentials as his contribution in securing Africa’s future through business.&nbsp;However, his net worth changes rapidly and is currently estimated by Forbes to be $11.5 billion.</p><p>Dangote has been cited severally to have ventured into business by first selling sweets as a schoolboy. He is also a business magnate, a member of several economic forums, a fervent investor, and a wealth builder, amongst many other things. However, he prefers to be referred to as an industrialist, seeing potential even in most unlikely places.</p><h2><strong>How Aliko Dangote’s Net Worth Of $11.5 Billion Came About</strong></h2><p>Although he opened his mind to business and started selling sweets at the age of 8, upon his graduation from the University in 1977 and at age 21, he moved to start a journey as a tradesman after relocating to Lagos. He did not let his young age limit him from trying different forms of businesses away from his family, who were mostly in Kano but traveled to different parts of Nigeria and West Africa for business.</p><p>Start-up capital was not a major limitation, and the entrepreneurial living legend was not afraid to invest and re-invest. He understood right from a young age that a little profit could always turn into a bigger one. Dangote still understood that he could not start a business and neither could he make a profit without capital; hence, he turned to <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>his family</a>, where he could get a loan of $3,000 from his uncle.</p><p>With the loan from Dantata, Aliko Dangote started to import consumer goods mainly via intermediary associates (firstly rice and sugar) from Thailand and Brazil in bulk. He would sort the goods into smaller quantities and sell them to local traders. Between making these commodities available and the profit margins, he generated enough to pay back the loan just three months later.</p><p>His success story started well, but his net worth at that time couldn’t set him up to become the richest man in Nigeria, especially because he was still a middleman. After a certain journey to Brazil in the 1990s, he made up his mind to start producing goods. This decision is the major reason why his net worth reached $25 billion in 2014 and is currently $11.5 billion.</p><h2><strong>He Established The Dangote Group in 1981</strong></h2><p>The Dangote Group was launched in 1981 under the auspices of Dangote Nigeria Limited and Blue Star Services. This was in an era when import licenses were required for bulk imports. This new stage required some changes for the growth of the business, and the entrepreneur was not afraid to delve. Following expansions, the Group opened up to more than 18 subsidiaries involving diverse industries, including salt, sugar, flour, and his most popular commodity to date – cement!</p><p>By the end of the 1990s, the Group manufactured textiles, refining sugar, processing salt, and milling flour. Soon after came the state award for a multi-million dollar cement factory, into which he obtained from the International Finance Corporation the sum of $479 million and sank in $349 million of personal savings. Asides from financial investment, he was responsible for initiating construction, and it was an eventual success in central and west Africa; no wonder today Dangote Cement is a household name.</p><h2><strong>Dangote Group Is</strong> <strong>Divided Into Different Subsidiaries</strong></h2><h3><strong>1.

Although there may be more than a handful of ways that the business tycoon may spend his money, those that have made it to the public are as follows:</p><h3><strong>Political Lobbying&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Aliko Dangote has at many times been connected to former Nigeria’s president,<a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal> Olusegun Obasanjo</a>. In 1999, he reportedly donated a huge amount, which helped in the success of the then-president.
