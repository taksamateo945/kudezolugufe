When it was revealed that James Gunn and Peter Safran will take over as co-CEOs of the newly established DC Studios in 2022, replacing Walter Hamada as the head of DC Films, the future of the DC film franchise underwent yet another significant transition. Although it is anticipated that the change in leadership will have a huge impact on the DC Universe for years to come, their influence may not be as noticeable in 2023. Since Warner Bros. planned to release multiple new DC pictures exclusively in theatres this year, the year was initially expected to play a big role in determining the shared universe’s destiny.</p><p>DC movies have not had fantastic years lately, which is one of the reasons the leadership has changed. COVID-19 hampered Birds of Prey’s box office performance, and the simultaneous release of Wonder Woman 1984 and The Suicide Squad in theatres and on HBO Max resulted in both films earning less than $170 million globally. Black Adam’s box office performance has been distorted in every manner imaginable, but it undoubtedly fell short for a Dwayne Johnson-starring superhero film. The good news is that there are a number of planned DC movies, so there is optimism that they will help revers this trend.</p><h3>Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom – December 25, 2023<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jason-Momoa-Aquaman-2-Lost-Kingdom-new-costume-suit.jpg alt="upcoming dc movies 2024,upcoming dc movies 2022,dc movie release dates 2022,upcoming dc animated movies 2022,upcoming movies,upcoming dc series,dc upcoming movies release date,dc movie news,upcoming dc animated movies 2023,dc comics upcoming movies 2023,upcoming marvel and dc movies 2023,upcoming dc movies 2021 to 2023,dc upcoming movies list 2023,new dc movies 2023,what dc movies are coming out in 2023,movies upcoming 2023,dc movies upcoming 2022" width=1400 height=700 sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The sequel to the DCU’s biggest box office blockbuster, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, will be <a href=#>released in December</a>, making Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom the final DC film to be released in 2023. Due to multiple postponements, the sequel will now be released five years after the first. The sequel’s director, James Wan, is back, and Jason Momoa reprises his role as Arthur Curry. In addition to these well-known actors, the cast of Aquaman 2 includes Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus, Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta, and Randall Park as Stephen Shin.</p><p>The plot of Aquaman 2 centres on Aquaman and Ocean Master joining forces in an unusual alliance. The film is also expected to have an appearance from Batman, with Ben Affleck temporarily taking the place of Michael Keaton. There are big anticipation for Aquaman 2 to be another another huge smash since the first film grossed $1 billion globally. The film, however, also marks the end of an era as it was the final one produced during the previous DC administration. Because of this, the final DC film, set for release in 2023, may be the last in the series before Gunn and Safran help relaunch the universe in some way.</p><h3>Blue Beetle – August 18, 2023<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blue-Beetle-August-18-2023.jpg alt="upcoming dc movies 2024,upcoming dc movies 2022,dc movie release dates 2022,upcoming dc animated movies 2022,upcoming movies,upcoming dc series,dc upcoming movies release date,dc movie news,upcoming dc animated movies 2023,dc comics upcoming movies 2023,upcoming marvel and dc movies 2023,upcoming dc movies 2021 to 2023,dc upcoming movies list 2023,new dc movies 2023,what dc movies are coming out in 2023,movies upcoming 2023,dc movies upcoming 2022" width=1500 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>A new hero will make their debut on the big screen in one of the DC movies scheduled for release in 2023. The title character, Jaime Reyes, a teenager, is the first Latino protagonist in a major superhero film, Blue Beetle. The film’s storyline was written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, and it is directed by Angel Manuel Soto (Charm City Kings) (Miss Bala). Jaime Reyes, played by Cobra Kai actor Xolo Marieduea, becomes the host for the symbiotic Blue Beetle scarab, giving him superhuman abilities. Bruna Marquezine, George Lopez, Harvey Guillén, and Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord are also featured in the cast of the Blue Beetle movie.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uf4c681af95e99b83aa45b489842b5b21><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>List Of Upcoming Hollywood Movies In 2022 | Most Anticipated Movies of 2022</span></a><p>Blue Beetle will make his first significant appearance in a live-action film since his creation in 2006, albeit very few plot information have been made public as of yet. Blue Beetle gained popularity on Young Justice at that point. The movie was initially intended for HBO Max, but the companies later decided to increase the budget and give it a theatrical release. There are no proven ties between Blue Beetle and the larger DC Universe at this time, but Jaime Reyes’ arrival gives an opportunity for the universe to grow and welcome new heroes.</p><h3>Shazam: Fury of the Gods – March 17, 2023<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Shazam-Fury-of-the-Gods-March-17-2023.jpg alt="upcoming dc movies 2024,upcoming dc movies 2022,dc movie release dates 2022,upcoming dc animated movies 2022,upcoming movies,upcoming dc series,dc upcoming movies release date,dc movie news,upcoming dc animated movies 2023,dc comics upcoming movies 2023,upcoming marvel and dc movies 2023,upcoming dc movies 2021 to 2023,dc upcoming movies list 2023,new dc movies 2023,what dc movies are coming out in 2023,movies upcoming 2023,dc movies upcoming 2022" width=1400 height=700 sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Shazam: Fury of the Gods, the first DC movie of 2023, debuts in March. Nearly four years after the release of the first Shazam film, which received overwhelmingly great reviews, comes the follow-up. Shazam: Fury of the Gods is directed once more by David F. Sandberg, with Zachary Levi reprising his role as Shazam and Asher Angel reprising his role as Billy Batson. The list of Shazam 2’s returning actors is rather large because Billy’s foster brothers both in their youthful and superhero forms are back. Grace Currey’s portrayal of Mary Bromfield and her Shazam form marks the largest change. Djimon Hounsou reprises his role as the Wizard in Shazam 2.</p><p>Billy Batson and the Shazam Family gain confidence in their abilities as the plot of Shazam: Fury of the Gods progresses. When Hespera (Helen Mirren) and Kalypso (Lucy Liu), the Daughters of Atlas, appear with plans to end the world, they put them to the test in a fresh way. It is also revealed that Rachel Zegler’s DC Universe character is a Daughter of Atlas, but based on the movie’s marketing, she seems to be more of a friend than an enemy. It is not anticipated that Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam will appear, despite having connections to the greater DC series. The inclusion of a cameo from Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman is confirmed.</p><h3>The Flash – June 16, 2023<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/The-Flash-June-16-2023.jpg alt="upcoming dc movies 2024,upcoming dc movies 2022,dc movie release dates 2022,upcoming dc animated movies 2022,upcoming movies,upcoming dc series,dc upcoming movies release date,dc movie news,upcoming dc animated movies 2023,dc comics upcoming movies 2023,upcoming marvel and dc movies 2023,upcoming dc movies 2021 to 2023,dc upcoming movies list 2023,new dc movies 2023,what dc movies are coming out in 2023,movies upcoming 2023,dc movies upcoming 2022" width=1500 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>In 2023, DC’s long-awaited <a href=#>The Flash</a> movie will finally be released. The Flash went through numerous filmmakers until Andy Muschietti joined the project. The Flash was first revealed in 2014 as a part of Warner Bros.’ aspirations to broaden the SnyderVerse. Barry Allen, who is once again portrayed by Ezra Miller, will appear in the film in a variety of roles as a result of the multiverse. Michael Keaton, Ben Affleck, and Michael Shannon’s General Zod all make comebacks as Batman in The Flash’s multiverse tale. Although there is a chance that more Justice League members may make brief appearances, Sasha Calle’s Supergirl will undoubtedly make her film debut.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ue801d7a6ebef3aef75ca69f6eb7df200><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>15 Disney Movies That'd Hit The Theaters In 2023</span></a><p>It is known that the story The Flash will convey is a loose adaption of the Flashpoint comic’s plot. Barry Allen breaks with the timeline in that story by travelling back in time to prevent his mother from passing away when he was a youngster, which is why his father was wrongfully imprisoned. The Flash is maintaining the basic plotline, but it seems that the modifications to his history that take place after saving her diverge from the original scenario. He meets Tim Burton movie villain Batman, played by Michael Keaton, and Supergirl in the universe they travel to. It’s been said for a while that The Flash resets the DC Universe timeline.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="upcoming dc movies 2024,upcoming dc movies 2022,dc movie release dates 2022,upcoming dc animated movies 2022,upcoming movies,upcoming dc series,dc upcoming movies release date,dc movie news,upcoming dc animated movies 2023,dc comics upcoming movies 2023,upcoming marvel and dc movies 2023,upcoming dc movies 2021 to 2023,dc upcoming movies list 2023,new dc movies 2023,what dc movies are coming out in 2023,movies upcoming 2023,dc movies upcoming 2022" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
