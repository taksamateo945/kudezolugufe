He and other members of AC/DC, including guitarist <a href=#>Angus Young</a>, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.</p><p>Phillip Hugh Norman Rudd (born Phillip Hugh Norman Witschke Rudzevecuis, 19 May 1954) is an Australian drummer, best known for his membership in Australian hard rock band AC/DC from 1975 through 1983, and again from 1994 to 2015. Upon the 1977 departure of bass guitarist Mark Evans from AC/DC, Rudd became the only Australian-born member of the band. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with the other members of AC/DC. Due to ongoing legal problems in New Zealand, Rudd was unable to join the band for the 2015 Rock or Bust tour and was replaced by Chris Slade. In 2014, Rudd released his first solo album, Head Job.</p><p>In 1974 Rudd was told about AC/DC’s rhythm section auditions by his former Coloured Balls bandmate Trevor Young (no relation to AC/DC’s Young brothers). Rudd asked Buster Brown bassist Geordie Leach to accompany him to the auditions, but Leach refused due to other commitments. Rudd auditioned and was hired immediately. Rudd’s drumming style suited the band’s style of music and became an integral part of AC/DC’s sound from 1975 to 1983. The band relocated to the United Kingdom in 1976 and followed a heavy schedule of international touring and recording.</p><p align=justify>He married Lisa O’Brien.

He began playing drums in his teens and became serious about pursuing a career in music. He played in several bands in Melbourne before joining Buster Brown with future Rose Tattoo vocalist Angry Anderson. They went on to release one album, Something To Say, in 1974, before Rudd left to join the Coloured Balls with Lobby Loyde.</p><h2>Phil Rudd Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Phil is one of the <strong>richest Drummer</strong> from Australia.

He eventually parted ways with the band in 1983 following the recording of the Flick of the Switch album. The split was partly the result of his own personal problems as well as a conflict with the band’s rhythm guitarist and founder Malcolm Young, which allegedly escalated to become physical. Rudd had completed his contributions to the album, and although session drummer B.J. Wilson was recruited to help complete the recording, Wilson’s drum parts were ultimately not used. Simon Wright was later hired as Rudd’s permanent replacement, and featured in the music videos released to promote the album.</p><h2>Who is Phil Rudd Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Phil Rudd</strong> married to <strong>Lisa O'Brien </strong>.
