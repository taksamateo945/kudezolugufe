In fact, the Montenegrin logged more minutes than he had at any point of his Bulls' tenure (33.5 per game). He has no obvious reason to expect to see a reduction this time around.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGmGeH6Mm6ylpKNixKq6zZ6prGWRo7FuuM6snKurXZu%2FsLmMa2dra12jr6J5xaucnmWRnLKvr9g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
