On July 8, she uploaded a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">photo</a> of her posing with actress <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jada Pinkett Smith</a></strong>, Will‚Äôs wife of over 20 years, in the same outfit she was pictured next to Will in. In the most recent photo, Elizabeth took a selfie with her two daughters <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordyn Woods</a></strong> and Jodie Woods, listing the Bahamas as her location. According to her caption, it appears the two families have gathered to celebrate Jaden‚Äôs 23rd birthday, which was on July 8.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pjimage-2021-07-12T120223.915-600x600.jpg><p>Fans who came across the picture of Will and Elizabeth dropped comments about Elizabeth‚Äôs supposed resemblance to actress La La Anthony, and others pointed out Will‚Äôs gray hairs. But it was clear which fans had little to no knowledge about the relationship between the Woods and the Smiths.</p><p>One unaware person said, ‚ÄúWill going mess around and have his own entanglement,‚Äù referring to last year when Jada addressed her controversial relationship she had with singer August Alsina while she was still married to Will. She called their relationship an ‚Äúentanglement‚Äù which created several Twitter memes, conversations, and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">song</a> from Alsina himself.</p><p>Lately, many fans have expressed their irritation about Jada continuously mentioning the late legendary rapper Tupac, so much so that many encourage Will to move on. ‚ÄúI hope that Will getting on with his life dropping Jada,‚Äù said someone else. Another wrote, ‚ÄúLet him rock out! He‚Äôs owed this entanglement.‚Äù</p><p>But real fans of the Woods and Smith families know that these two families have years of history between them. Many found out about their relationship when Jordyn got into an entanglement of her own in 2019 with her former best friend‚Äôs sister, Khloe Kardashian, and Khloe‚Äôs ex-boyfriend/father of her child Tristan Thompson. Her appearance on Jada‚Äôs Facebook Watch series ‚ÄúRed Table Talk‚Äù explained how the families have known each other for so long.</p><p>Jordyn‚Äôs now-deceased father, John Woods, was a television engineer, and he met Smith on the set of his hit sitcom ‚ÄúThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.‚Äù This led to Jordyn, 23, and Jaden, 23, being best friends as well when they were children. John passed away in 2017 two weeks after being diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>Will‚Äôs other children Willow Smith and Trey Smith and Elizabeth‚Äôs sons John Woods Jr. and Joshua Woods were not seen in the photos, so it is not clear if they made it to the trip. It‚Äôs good to see the families still so close.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49wZmpqX6y2rbiMrKSirJhirq%2BwjKOmq5ypo3q4u86dqmaln6J6prjIs5ibnaSderi7zp2qZqyRoLJuvMeoq6hlpJ2utXnSqZiro6Nisq%2FAwKeepZ2dmru1ecKopKadnqnAbrLRqKRmnpGjwG7BzZqumqqVYrynedOhnGaekaK2rbXErGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
