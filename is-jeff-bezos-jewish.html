It’s unclear whether or not Bezos is Jewish. On all of Bezos’ biographies, like the one on Biography, his religion is omitted. There has been a lot of speculation on the question and there is evidence that he may actually be Catholic, despite rumors and anti-Semitic attacks that believe otherwise."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There has been a lot of speculation on the question and there is evidence that he may actually be Catholic, despite rumors and anti-Semitic attacks that believe otherwise.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_1399561361-1024x758.jpg><p>Continue reading below to find out more about whether Jeff Bezos is Jewish, Catholic or neither.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bezos’ Catholic Step-Father&nbsp;</h2><p>Jeff Bezos was born on <a href=# rel=noopener>January 12, 1964</a> to his mother, Jacklyn Gise, and his biological father, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen.</p><p>They were both still in high school when Jeff was born and when he turned 17 months old, Gise and Jorgensen got a <a href=# rel=noopener>divorce</a>.</p><p>His mother later remarried Miguel “Mike” Bezos who adopted Jeff and gave him the last name Bezos when he was <a href=# rel=noopener>4 years old</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike seems to have been raised in the Roman Catholic Church, as when he immigrated to the United States, he did so through a Catholic-run program called <a href=# rel=noopener>Operation Peter Pan</a>.</p><p>Mike was placed in a Catholic group home, then later attended the Catholic-affiliated <a class=rank-math-link href=# rel=noopener>University of Albuquerque</a> in New Mexico. Once Mike graduated though, he married Jacklyn Gise in a Protestant church called the <a href=# rel=noopener>First Congregational Church of Christ</a> in Albuquerque.</p><p>This has led people to believe that Mike was not a practicing Roman Catholic and thus may not have raised Bezos to be one either.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bezos’ Wedding</h2><p>Bezos’ now ex-wife, however, seems to have had more of a concrete Catholic upbringing. Bezos married MacKenzie in <a href=# rel=noopener>1993</a>, but recently got divorced after 25 years of marriage.</p><p>MacKenzie’s parents, Jason, and Holiday Tuttle <a href=# rel=noopener>are active members</a> of the Catholic community in Palm Beach, Florida. This means that they likely raised MacKenzie to be Catholic as well.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Further evidence</a> shows that Jeff and MacKenzie were married by a minister, Reverend Richard Riccardi, from the Old Catholic Church of new Utrecht.</p><p>This could be because of MacKenzie’s Catholic upbringing and not Bezos, but it leads people to further believe that Bezos is in fact Catholic.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Charity Cases</h2><p>Although Bezos owns <a href=# rel=noopener>many companies</a>, most notably amazon, but also Whole Foods, IMDB, Goodreads, etc. He also donates to various charities.</p><p>In 2018, Bezos <a href=# rel=noopener>donated $97.5 million</a> to 24 organizations, 5 of which are affiliated with Christian (both Catholic and Protestant) institutions. This does not necessarily mean he is Christian himself, but it does seem more likely.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jewish or Not?&nbsp;</h2><p>Despite most evidence and research pointing towards Bezos being Catholic, he was still the victim of an anti-Semitic attack online. In 2019, Bezos was being criticized because The Washington Post (which Bezos owns) was investigating Saudi Arabia’s human rights abuses.</p><p>Many tweets and Facebook posts about Bezos were circulating, including this <a href=# class=rank-math-link rel=noopener>one</a>: “We as Saudis will never accept to be attacked by The Washington Post in the morning, only to buy products from Amazon and&nbsp;<a href=# class=rank-math-link rel=noopener>Souq.com</a>&nbsp;by night! Strange that all three companies are owned by the same Jew who attacks us by day, and sells us products by night!”</p><p>In the translated tweet, the writer states that Bezos is Jewish despite this never being confirmed.&nbsp;While most research seems to point towards Bezos being Catholic, he has never confirmed or denied either religion.</p><p>This may be to protect his image as much as he can as even speculations about whether or not he is Jewish caused backlash and anti-Semitism.</p><p>It is also possible that Bezos may not belong to any religion.</p><p>Although Christianity is the largest religion in the United States, with <a href=# rel=noopener>70% of the population</a> practicing a denomination, 15.8% of the population claims they have no religion. So, Bezos could be part of that group. Until he addresses it for himself, we may never know for sure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZqKVm7NursSzpqxlmprEqr%2FHaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
