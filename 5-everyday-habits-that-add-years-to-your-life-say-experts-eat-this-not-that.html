Absolutely. And there’s no denying that the body changes with age ( a reason many women don’t care to get “bikini ready” as they feel that ship has already sailed.. although I choose to disagree). In the midst of searching for more health and a better wellbeing, and to dissociate from years of horrible dieting experiences, women may inadvertently increase their chances of chronic disease and poor health. Statistically we can’t deny that obesity and being overweight increases the risk of certain cancers, heart disease (a major killer for women over 50 now that estrogen levels have declined) not to mention Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.. I want to be clear, we are all beautiful at all shapes and sizes, but each of us has a healthy weight we were meant to be, whether that’s a size 8 or a size 20. The goal is still the same. It’s not necessarily about fitting into a bikini, but it’s absolutely about getting to your healthiest weight in order to balance hormones and stave off disease.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/05/man-dog-explaining-e1652930879952.jpg><p><span>Jackie Newgent</span><span>, RDN, CDN, New York City-based plant-forward culinary nutritionist and author of The</span><span> All-Natural Diabetes Cookbook</span><span> states, “If you don’t have a dog or cat, adopt one. Owners say that their pets bring so much joy to their lives. And </span><span>studies</span><span> that go beyond that. A research review published in Circulation finds that dog and cat ownership is linked to a lower risk of death, which is potentially due to reduced cardiovascular mortality.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/12/woman-biting-chocolate-bar-dessert-e1650507122577.jpg><p><span>Newgent says, “While indulging in daily candy bars is not the way to go; savoring a small bite (slightly less than one serving) of chocolate every week may be a smart and scrumptious way to boost longevity. And it appears to be better to have it than to not have it at all. </span><span>John Hopkins Medicine </span><span>states that dark chocolate increases heart health, balances the immune system, combats diabetes, improves brain function and more. “</span><span>Dark chocolate has many health benefits and can definitely be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet. There are many healthy ways to incorporate chocolate into your lifestyle, so find what works for you.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/05/person-eating-walnuts-e1657077286370.jpg><p><span>Newgent shares, “</span><span>Oxford </span><span>researchers found that walnut consumption may be linked with a lower risk of death and an increase in life expectancy among older adults in the U.S. The magic number appears to be five. When compared to people who didn’t eat walnuts, eating five or more servings of walnuts a week was associated with a gain of about 1.3 years of life expectancy. And, of course, you can have the nuts as a snack or enjoy them in delightful recipes.”</span><span aria-hidden=true>6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3uUZpyvnaKusaLFjKGYm6GkqHq1tMCtZJqclGLGpq3RrGStp12uvLa%2BjKWgn51dqK66ecSxp56qpKh6pq3TZquhoaNiu7DAjK2fmqxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
