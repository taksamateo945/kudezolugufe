They don’t want people prying too much. It’s taken a lot of communication, but she’s working on trusting him again. It’s been shown a lot on the show, but they’ve been in therapy. Her family had more trouble forgiving him than she did, but they love and support Porsha and want her to be happy.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Porsha is doing the most she can amid all the drama and rumors involving her baby daddy.
