This past March, Kate <a href=#>told <strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> that her ex-husband’s outspoken remarks to the media meant very little to her. “I mean, everybody is entitled to their opinions,” she told <strong>Us</strong>. “I don’t let it bother me or affect me that much. I’m led by my gut, my heart, and doing what I’ve always set out to do as a parent.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmZ6ZpanGcLrEsKpoo5Gpsm6zzqyqnqSZo3q2utGemqifnp7Hoq7LnmSfp6Jiv6bBzaKmp2WnnsGpecmopWafn6jAprjIp2RraGFpf3h9jw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
