The incident occurred during Wednesday night's game against the Atlanta Braves. According to ESPN.com, &#34;Pillar struck out swinging to end the seventh inning, he says, after he was quick-pitched by Braves pitcher Jason Motte, yelling toward the mound before Braves catcher Kurt Suzuki stepped in to calm things and the benches cleared."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Freddie Freeman exited the game in the&nbsp;fifth inning after being hit by a pitch in the wrist, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Bahr</a>&nbsp;of Fox Sports. The benches then cleared twice in the game, both after the incident with Pillar and again in the eighth inning after Jose Bautista flipped his bat following a solo home run:</p><p>Toronto general manager&nbsp;<span>Ross Atkins said the Blue Jays consulted with&nbsp;<span>Major League Baseball and the players association before deciding on the punishment, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN.com</a>.</span></span></p><p>"Yeah, I mean, obviously [the quick pitch] was the initial thing I was upset about but I think it just stems from a little frustration in myself and just the way this series has been going. It was immature, it was stupid, it was uncalled for. It's part of the game, it's just, I'm a competitive guy and a heat of the moment. Obviously I'm going to do whatever I've got to do to reach out and apologize and let him know he didn't do anything wrong, it was all me. Obviously something to learn from, something to move on from. Don't let it define me but really I think it was just frustration from coming off a really good homestand and really just not even being in any of these ball games, just coming out flat and not being able to build on what we were able to build on against&nbsp;<a href=#>Seattle</a>. That just all came out in that moment."</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chisholm</a>, Pillar's pay for those two games will be donated, though the specifics remain unresolved.</p><p>The Blue Jays have found themselves in this position before&nbsp;when Yunel Escobar displayed an anti-gay slur on his eye black&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2012</a>&nbsp;and was suspended three games by the team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXBpYGmFc3nKnq2ipl2ltq24wKtkrK2jpbKvsMSdZGtll5a6pr%2BMn6arZZikurC8x6iZoptdmLyuucSnq6xlpKR6q63SqKVmpZ%2BpwaZ6</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
