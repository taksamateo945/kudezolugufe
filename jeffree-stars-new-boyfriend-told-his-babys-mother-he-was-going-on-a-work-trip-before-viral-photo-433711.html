After the picture went viral, some things came to light about Andre.</p><p>Even before Andre was identified, social media users speculated that he was hiring a person of color to pretend to be his love interest as damage control. However, <a href=#>Star</a> took to social media to say that he never pays anyone to be with him.</p><p>When Mardhold was identified by the tattoos on his arm that appeared in a photo of him letting <a href=#>Jeffree</a> sit on his lap, the drama began.</p><p>It turns out, Andre just had a baby with his alleged ex-girlfriend who claims she was blindsided by the sight of the viral photo. To make the speculation that he is doing it for money even more plausible — she claims he told her he was going to LA for work.</p><p>There were also rumors that the baller who plays overseas was married but Jeffree took to Twitter to say that he doesn’t hook up with married men.</p><p>Andre’s ex-girlfriend, Leezy, completed an interview with Life and Style where she got extremely emotional.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CErkWsohYcy/</a></p><p>‘It [was] just humiliating for me because my family called me, my friend from France called me. Everybody was blowing up my phone, so I couldn’t [go on] my phone. I trusted him because he said he was going there for work. Then, you know, I tried to communicate with him, but it was just like hard to. So, from this day until now, we’ve had, like, no communication.’</p><p>The actress was near tears as she revealed his stuff is still at her house because they were allegedly living together.</p><p>‘I’m still hurt and confused about the situation because I do not know, I don’t know what’s going on, honestly.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As for Andre and Jeffree, they’re still going strong as seen in a photo posted on August 29.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeamrOnvsSeZKyskafAbrrEsGSbp6mbv6qxzZ1kraecmXqptdJmmZqaqah6rrvToZyrZZiaerit0maeqKGenHqwuoyaZLCnoqB6tb7IqWSbnZakv6Z51aKpmqRdpbWwwM5ma2xrZ2Z%2BcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
