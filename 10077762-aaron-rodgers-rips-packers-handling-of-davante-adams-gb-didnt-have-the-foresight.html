I'm the best receiver in the league, and you're gonna offer me less than Christian Kirk?'" Rodgers said. "With all due respect, he's not on Davante's level.</p><p>"I'm sure that the team will say that's just the business of negotiation—it's like, yeah, but you're also sending a message to that guy, and a lot of times it can stick with guys and make them a little sour on things. … That goes back to the first offer that they made, and I don't think [the Packers] had the foresight—obviously didn't have the foresight."</p><p>Schneidman noted that Adams said on an appearance on the <i>I Am Athlete</i> podcast that the initial offer he received from the Packers prior to the 2021 season was for less than $20 million annually.</p><p>Upon being acquired by the Raiders, Adams <a href=# rel=noopener>signed</a> a new five-year contract worth $140 million, which made him the highest-paid receiver in the league at the time of his signing at $28 million per year. The 30-year-old made his sixth straight Pro Bowl after leading the NFL with 14 receiving touchdowns while also ranking third with 1,516 yards on 100 catches.</p><p>Adams excelling in Las Vegas came as no surprise after his fruitful partnership with Rodgers in Green Bay. The duo connected for 68 touchdowns, the most between a quarterback and receiver in Packers franchise history.</p><p>Rodgers struggled to find a groove without Adams on the outside during the 2022 season. He took a while to develop chemistry with Green Bay's new crop of young wideouts and threw 12 interceptions, the first time he's thrown 10 or more picks in a season since 2010.</p><p>Now, Rodgers will have his own opportunity to excel in a new environment, as his presence brings high expectations to a New York team that hasn't made the playoffs in 12 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2yEd36Mmpirp55iv7Cwxp6prGWinr20ec%2BamqSdoqh6qa3NnaOippdivKd5w5qtmqakmnqisMCmqmafkmKxqrDNrWShmaaaerW0xGadqKqVqLaotNM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
