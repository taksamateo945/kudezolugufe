The former Friends star launched a new vegan and cruelty-free haircare line this week, debuting the first product of the collection. Dubbed <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>LolaVie</a> (the actress named her first car Lola) Jennifer shared photos and details of the collection on her social media account, also unveiling on the brand's as well.</p><p>"Today LolaVie officially launches ‚Äì a little idea from <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>@jenniferaniston</a> that evolved into a line made to help your hair feel healthy and look effortless," one of the first post's on LolaVie's Instagram account reads, alongside a photo of the gorgeous star. "Our products are made with plant-based, naturally-derived ingredients ‚Äî and WITHOUT parabens, silicones, sulfates, phthalates, and gluten‚Ä¶ and of course we are vegan and CRUELTY-FREE! ü§ç Our first product, The Glossing Detangler, is officially available today (tap!) ‚Äì but there's SO much more to come. We can't wait to hear what you think."</p><p>"T‚Äã‚Äãhis project has been in the works for a long time and I'm so excited to finally be able to introduce it to you. So much hard work from our incredible team went into making this line," she added in a post on her personal account.</p><p>Usually, the first ingredient of a haircare product is water. However, Glossing Detangler uses nourishing, sustainable bamboo essence instead. Aniston told <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Vogue</a> that lemon extract imparts "extraordinary shine," while vegetable ceramides replace conditioning chemicals, including silicones which can offer instant results at the expense of damage in the long-run.</p><p>"I use detanglers all the time when I get out of the shower because of the condition of my hair; it's hard to get through," she told the magazine, adding that she hopes it will be "the Swiss Army knife of products: It's a heat protector, it brings nutrients and health back to the hair follicle, it creates shine," she says.</p><p>Why a haircare line? "This just felt pretty organic to me as my hair is something that has always been one of my struggles," the star told Vogue.</p><p>LolaVie The Glossing Detangler is available for $25 on the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>brand's website </a>with free shipping.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxko52eo7ansdFmmKeho6m8r3nUp62eoZyoeq%2Bx1mafmqGiYrCivsRmmauZnpl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
