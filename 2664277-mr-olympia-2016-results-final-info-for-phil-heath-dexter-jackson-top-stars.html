Heath was the name everyone was watching on Saturday night after winning each of the previous five Mr. Olympia titles dating back to 2011. The 36-year-old has shown no signs of slowing down and caught a break when it was announced Kai Greene would not be participating."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So I think I’ve still got time."</span></p><p><span>There's no one else challenging Heath at this stage of the game. He's one of the most dominant athletes in all of sports after winning his sixth straight Sandow Trophy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Vozmadridista.com captured some of the images that showcase Heath's physique and why the judges have been unable to find someone better than him in each of the last six Mr. Olympia competitions:</span></p>vozmadridista.com <span class=acct>@VozMadridista</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Congrats @PHILHEATH Well deserved entrance into the very selected 6+ Legendary Club #MrOlympia https://t.co/ualEeW8zAf</p><p>Making Heath's wins more impressive is the field he's challenging is not lacking talent. Even with Greene's absence, Jackson, who was the 2008 champion, finished in the top three for the second straight year.&nbsp;</p><p>Even at 46 years old, Jackson was clearly disheartened by his final result. He did lose one spot from his 2015 finish, though he's at an age in which his body should be starting to break down.&nbsp;</p><p>Finishing between Heath and Jackson was Jamaican star Shawn Rhoden, who came into Mr. Olympia looking better than ever, as this photo from Rick Collins showcases:</p>Rick Collins <span class=acct>@RickCollinsEsq</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Congrats to true gentleman Shawn Rhoden for his highest placing yet as runner-up Mr. Olympia. @FlexatronRhoden https://t.co/GIjmmzFnGn</p><p>One of the controversial decisions involved Big Ramy (<span>Mamdouh Elssbiay)</span> finishing fourth, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RXMuscle.com</a> noted on Twitter drew some boos from the crowd in Las Vegas because he could easily have gone higher.&nbsp;</p><p>Per Luimarco on Instagram, during a posedown, Ramy even seemed to look better than Heath:</p><p>Ramy is still in the embryonic stage of his career at 32 years old, having not competed in major events until 2012. He's improved his final position in each of his four Mr. Olympia appearances, going from eighth in 2013 to seventh in 2014 and fifth last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Heath didn't get his first Mr. Olympia title until he was 31 years old, so there is plenty of time for Ramy to make that final leap from No. 4 to first place.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Olympia has been defined by Heath's performance for each of the last six years. This year was not the overwhelming showcase for him during this process, but all that matters is hearing his name called by the judges as a winner.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9uZGeEeHnMq2SopKmivaqtjGtnam5dp7K0wcutqmaemaOurXnIp52oZZakv268x6KjZqCVlsGpecOer62domK3oq%2FKrKanZaSkvW6%2F05qprA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
